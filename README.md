This is a python script I created to scrape Telegram messages. The main purpose for this script is to scrape Telegram channels for messages that contain information pertitnent to you. 
For example a cybersecurity analyst may want to scrape Telegram channels to keep an eye out for new malware and scams that they would need to be aware of to protect themselves, and, or their client from.
